# Advance Flutter App implementes BLOC
As a flutter app grows rapidly, you will realize that using simple state management (Statful Widget) is no longer an option. Until this moment state management best practice in Flutter has not exist yet.

## Architecture
- ###Code sharing: 
    This architecture approach might have share more then 70% of code between diffrent platforms (web, mobile). However, abstracting and dependency injection which the way of implementing this architecture might be complex and overwhelmed
- ###Testing: 
    Testing is easier where UI and business logic are separated which can be tested separately.
